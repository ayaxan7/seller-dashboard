# Common Errors & Solutions

This document lists common errors you might encounter and their solutions.

## Firebase Errors

### 1. ‚ùå FAILED_PRECONDITION: The query requires an index

**Error Message:**
```
com.google.firebase.firestore.FirebaseFirestoreException: FAILED_PRECONDITION: 
The query requires an index.
```

**Solution:**
‚úÖ **Already Fixed!** The app now sorts products in memory instead of using Firestore's `orderBy()`, which requires a composite index.

**Optional**: For better performance with large product lists, you can create the index:
1. Click the URL in the error message (it takes you directly to the index creation page)
2. OR manually create it in Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Indexes
   - Collection: `products`
   - Fields: `vendorId` (Ascending), `createdAt` (Descending)

**Error Message:**
```

- Gradle sync not completed

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `google-services.json` is in `/app/` directory
2. Check package name in `google-services.json` matches `com.ayaan.sellerdashboard`

**Solutions:**

**For Firestore:**
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules

     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2025, 12, 31);
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Update the date if expired

       match /{allPaths=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2025, 12, 31);

- [ ] Is there internet connection?
- [ ] Have you tried Clean Project ‚Üí Rebuild?
- [ ] Have you tried Invalidate Caches & Restart?

## Still Having Issues?

1. Check Android Studio's **Logcat** for detailed error messages
2. Look for the full stack trace (red text in Logcat)

## Pro Tips

üí° **Enable Verbose Logging**
For Firebase debugging, enable debug logging:
```kotlin
FirebaseFirestore.setLoggingEnabled(true)
```

üí° **Test Mode Rules Expiration**
Remember to update the date in test mode rules regularly, or switch to production rules.

üí° **Check Firebase Status**
Visit [Firebase Status Dashboard](https://status.firebase.google.com/) to check if Firebase services are down.

üí° **Offline Persistence**
Firestore has offline persistence enabled by default. Sometimes you need to clear app data to reset the cache.
